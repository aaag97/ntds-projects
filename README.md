## Project Description

Richard P. Feynman once claimed that “religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt”. In Feynman’s view, science and religion represent two distinct and opposing cultures. This is a very modern take on the relationship between science and religion. It is in fact a very mainstream opinion to have in the West. However, some scientists seem to disagree. 51\% of US scientists reported that they believe in at least some form of higher power in 2009. The relationship between science and religion does not appear to be as straightforward as modern society seems to think.

This project has a few aims. The first one is to examine both the intra and inter relationships that we can find between science and religion, and to infer the reasons behind the relationships found such as common origins or ideas. The second one is to try to classify new documents according to the clustering that we obtain. The ultimate goal is to try to come up with a new categorization of scientific and religious articles which would reflect the ties between them more accurately and which would not take into account the typically strong opposition between them.
